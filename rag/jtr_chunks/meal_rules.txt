=== Meal Reimbursement Rules ===

- Meal receipts are not required if claiming per diem (M&IE).
- If meals are provided at no cost (e.g., training, conference, or base dining), they must be deducted.
- Complimentary hotel breakfasts do not reduce M&IE.
- MREs do not count as provided meals unless ordered.

Actual Expense Allowance (AEA) for meals requires full receipts and justification.
