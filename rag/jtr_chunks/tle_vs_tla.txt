=== TLE vs TLA ===

TLE (Temporary Lodging Expense):
- For CONUS moves only
- Up to 5 days reimbursed
- Claimed through eFinance

TLA (Temporary Lodging Allowance):
- For OCONUS moves
- Based on actual expenses and local allowance
- Claimed through your base housing office or finance

Only one can be claimed per move; never both.
